Monte Carlo Trading Simulator
1. Project Overview
This project is a sophisticated financial projection tool designed to simulate the potential long-term outcomes of a given trading strategy. By leveraging the Monte Carlo method, the simulator runs thousands or even hundreds of thousands of unique "lifetimes" of a trading account, providing a statistical distribution of possible futures rather than a single, linear projection.

The goal is to provide traders and strategists with a robust understanding of risk, the probability of success, the risk of ruin, and the likely range of financial returns over a specified timeline.

2. Core Features
The simulator is a feature-rich web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, offering the following capabilities:

Customizable Simulation Parameters: Users can define all critical variables of their trading strategy:

Initial Account Balance

Risk per Trade (% of Account)

Trades per Week

Average Win Rate (%)

Risk-to-Reward Ratio

Monthly Expenses & Start Date

Simulation Timeline (in months)

Number of Simulation Runs (up to 100,000)

Estimated Fees per Trade

Comprehensive Statistical Analysis: Upon completion, the simulator provides a high-level summary of key performance indicators:

Survival Rate: The percentage of simulations that remained solvent.

Profitable / Losing / Ruined Outcomes: A clear breakdown of what percentage of simulations ended with a profit, a loss (but not ruined), or were completely wiped out.

Key Scenarios: Clickable summaries for the Average, Median, Best Case, and Worst Case outcomes, allowing users to inspect the month-by-month P&L for that specific scenario.

Adaptive Outcome Distribution:

The simulator intelligently groups the thousands of outcomes into 10 clear, readable buckets.

It uses an adaptive algorithm to focus on the most probable 98% of outcomes, grouping extreme outliers into a final "catch-all" bucket to prevent skewed or unreadable results.

Each bucket is color-coded (Green, Yellow, Red) to instantly show the most to least likely clusters of outcomes.

The distribution is sorted with the highest probability outcomes at the top.

Annualized ROI Calculation:

Each outcome bucket displays the annualized Return on Investment (ROI) range for the simulations within it, providing a clear measure of performance that is comparable across different timelines.

Recursive Interactive Drill-Downs:

Any outcome bucket or sub-bucket representing a significant cluster of results (>=25%) becomes clickable.

This allows the user to perform a nested "drill-down" analysis, revealing a more granular 10-bar histogram of the results within that specific range.

The navigation includes a proper "Back" button, allowing users to step back through their analysis path instead of being sent back to the main summary.

3. Planned Features & Next Steps
The current simulation model uses perfectly independent randomness (Math.random()) for determining trade outcomes. While statistically useful, it does not fully capture the complexities of real-world markets. The next major phase of development is to evolve the simulation into a more data-driven and realistic model.

Phase 1: Data Collection (Forward Testing)
The immediate next step is to move from theoretical inputs to real-world data.

Action: The trading bot will be paper-traded on a live market feed for a period of 1 to 3 months.

Goal: To collect empirical data on the strategy's true performance characteristics, specifically identifying its peak performing win rate (during favorable conditions) and its lowest performing win rate (during unfavorable conditions).

Phase 2: Implement Market Regimes
Using the data collected in Phase 1, the simulation logic will be fundamentally upgraded.

Action: The calculateMonthlyProfit function will be replaced with a new version that simulates fluctuating "market regimes."

Goal: The bot's win rate will no longer be a static variable. Instead, it will drift between the observed peak and low win rates gathered from the forward test. This will simulate the natural ebb and flow of a strategy's performance as market conditions (e.g., trending vs. ranging) change over time.

Phase 3: Long-Term Backtesting (Ultimate Goal)
To build the most robust model possible, the forward-test data will be combined with a much larger historical dataset.

Action: The bot's logic will be tested against 2-5 years of historical market data.

Goal: This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the strategy's performance across a wide variety of market types, including different volatility levels and major economic events. The data from this backtest will be used to refine the market regime parameters, resulting in a highly accurate and predictive simulation tool.
